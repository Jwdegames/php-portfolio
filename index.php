			<h2><u><b>About Me</b></u></h2>

			<p>
				Howdy! I'm a Computer Science and Statistics double major at Texas A&M and plan to graduate in 2024! I also have minors in Mathematics and Cybersecurity. 
				I'm intersted in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, Cybersecurity, and Human-Computer Interaction. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Right now, I'm an undergraduate researcher for the Sketch Recognition Lab (SRL) and a student web technician for the Texas A&M Health Science Center (TAMHSC). 
				For the	SRL, I'm currently helping out to implement a sketch recognition library that can be used for future projects. As part of the TAMHSC, I help to
				maintain over 40 different websites for TAMU schools, education centers, and health centers across Texas. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I love tutoring and helping others out. During the School Year, I do peer teaching and peer mentoring for the College of Engineering. Also, in high school, 
				I was part of the SciNow club for my high school, which taught elementary kids advanced science topics. Furthermore, I was also part of the 
				Youth Expanding Services (Y.E.S) program, where I volunteered for various organizations.
